# Debugging Calendar to Table Navigation

## 🔍 Debug Logs Added

I've added comprehensive console logging to help identify why the task isn't being activated. Here's what to check:

---

## 📋 How to Debug

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Open your app
2. Press `F12` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac)
3. Go to the **Console** tab
4. Clear any existing logs

### Step 2: Click a Task in Calendar
1. Navigate to calendar view
2. Click on any task
3. Watch the console output

### Step 3: Check the Logs

You should see this sequence:

```
📅 Calendar: Task clicked, ID: "f74ad551-7667-4575-afac-62480d9a1b70" Type: "string"
📅 Calendar: Calling onOpenTask with ID: "f74ad551-7667-4575-afac-62480d9a1b70"
📅 Calendar navigation - Task ID: "f74ad551-7667-4575-afac-62480d9a1b70" Type: "string"
✅ State updated - View: table, Page: 1, Selected: ["f74ad551-7667-4575-afac-62480d9a1b70"]
🔍 Looking for task with ID: "f74ad551-7667-4575-afac-62480d9a1b70"
📍 Task row found: Yes
✨ Highlight added to task
```

---

## ⚠️ Possible Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Task Row Not Found
```
📍 Task row found: No
⚠️ Task row not found in DOM.
Looking for: "f74ad551-7667-4575-afac-62480d9a1b70"
Available task IDs: ["abc-123", "def-456", ...]
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. Task is filtered out by search/sort
2. Task is on a different page
3. Task data hasn't loaded yet
4. Task ID format mismatch

**Solutions:**
- ✅ I've cleared search params
- ✅ I've cleared sort filters
- ✅ I've reset to page 1
- ✅ I've added retry mechanism (800ms + 500ms)

**If still failing:**
- Check if the task ID in "Looking for" matches any in "Available task IDs"
- If not, the task might not be in the filtered dataset

### Issue 2: onOpenTask Not Called
```
⚠️ Calendar: onOpenTask function not provided!
```

**Solution:**
- This shouldn't happen now, but if it does, check that `Sheets.jsx` is passing `handleOpenTaskFromCalendar` to `SheetCalendar`

### Issue 3: Task Loads But Not Selected
```
📍 Task row found: Yes
✨ Highlight added to task
(But checkbox not checked)
```

**Possible Cause:**
- State update timing issue

**Check:**
- Look for the log: `✅ State updated - View: table, Page: 1, Selected: [...]`
- Verify the task ID is in the Selected array

---

## 🔧 Enhanced Features Added

### 1. **Cleared Filters**
When navigating from calendar:
- ✅ Search filters cleared
- ✅ Sort filters cleared
- ✅ Page reset to 1

### 2. **Longer Wait Time**
- Increased from 300ms to 800ms
- Allows time for data to load from server

### 3. **Retry Mechanism**
- If task not found initially, retries after 500ms
- Helps with slow-loading data

### 4. **Detailed Logging**
- Shows task ID and type
- Shows which tasks are available
- Shows each step of the process

## 🎯 What Should Happen

### Correct Flow:
1. **Click task in calendar**
2. **View switches to table** (instant)
3. **Filters cleared** (instant)
4. **Page reset to 1** (instant)
5. **Task selected** (checkbox checked)
6. **Wait 800ms** for data to load
7. **Find task row** in DOM
8. **Scroll to task** (smooth animation)
9. **Add highlight** (purple pulse + gradient bar)
10. **Wait 2 seconds**
11. **Remove highlight** (task stays selected)

## 📊 Common Problems

### Problem 1: Task ID Mismatch
```
Looking for: "abc-123"
Available:   ["ABC-123", "def-456"]
```

**Issue:** Case sensitivity or format difference

**Check in console:**
- Compare the "Looking for" ID with "Available task IDs"
- If they don't match exactly, there's a format issue

### Problem 2: Task Not Loaded Yet
```
📍 Task row found: No
Available task IDs: []
```

**Issue:** Table hasn't loaded any tasks

**Possible causes:**
- Server request pending
- Data not fetched yet
- Network issue

**Solution:**
- Wait a bit longer
- Check network tab for API calls
- Verify task query is working

### Problem 3: Task Filtered Out
```
📍 Task row found: No
Available task IDs: ["other-id-1", "other-id-2"]
```

**Issue:** Task exists but is filtered out

**Check:**
- Is there an active search query?
- Are there filters applied?
- Is the task on a different sheet?

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Test 1: Basic Navigation
```
1. Click task in calendar
2. Check console shows: "Task row found: Yes"
3. Verify checkbox is checked
4. Verify purple highlight appears
```

### Test 2: Task at Bottom
```
1. Scroll calendar to find a task with high order number
2. Click it
3. Should scroll smoothly to bottom of table
4. Task should be centered and highlighted
```

### Test 3: Multiple Clicks
```
1. Click task A in calendar
2. Immediately click task B
3. Should navigate to task B (not A)
4. Only task B should be highlighted
```

## 🚀 Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Hard Refresh
```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try again
```

### Fix 2: Check Task Query
```javascript
// In console, run:
document.querySelectorAll('[data-task-id]').length
// Should return number of tasks in table
```

### Fix 3: Manual Test
```javascript
// In console, run:
const taskId = "YOUR-TASK-ID-HERE";
const row = document.querySelector(`[data-task-id="${taskId}"]`);
console.log('Found:', row);
// Should show the task row element
```

## 🔍 Next Steps

After you click a task in calendar:

1. **Open browser console** (F12)

3. **Share them** so I can see exactly what's happening
4. I'll identify the issue and fix it!

The debug logs will show exactly where the process is failing. 🎯
